# 🛰️ GShareWiFi App

**GShareWiFi** is a **Google Apps Script (GAS)** web application that automates the creation, synchronization, and issuance of **WiFi vouchers** using **MacroDroid** automation on Android.

It connects your **Gmail**, **Google Drive**, and **MacroDroid** workflows — allowing you to issue WiFi access vouchers automatically when customers send payments via **GCash** or **Maya**.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Once set up, GShareWiFi can:
- Read new **“Recharge Card”** emails from your provider.  
- Extract voucher codes and group them by amount (₱5, ₱10, ₱20, etc.).  
- Store them in Google Drive as text files.  
- Generate and sync a **MacroDroid macro** that can automatically send WiFi vouchers to users.

When integrated with **GCash** or **Maya push notifications**, MacroDroid detects incoming payments and triggers the webhook — automatically issuing a matching WiFi voucher via SMS based on the amount sent.

💡 **Example:**  
A ₱10 GCash payment → triggers the push notification → sends back a ₱10 WiFi voucher SMS automatically.

## 📲 How It Works with GCash / Maya

Once your MacroDroid automation is linked with GShareWiFi:

1. A customer sends a payment via **GCash** or **Maya**.
2. **MacroDroid detects the push notification** (e.g., “You received ₱10 from...”).
3. The MacroDroid macro triggers the **Webhook URL** generated by GShareWiFi.
4. GShareWiFi identifies the voucher file that matches the payment amount (e.g., ₱10 → `10php_vouchers.txt`).
5. The system automatically sends a **WiFi voucher code via SMS** to the payer’s phone number.

💡 Example:  
A ₱20 payment → triggers webhook → voucher issued → customer receives their ₱20 WiFi voucher instantly via SMS.

With this setup, your WiFi vending system runs **fully automated**, 24/7 — no manual input required.
